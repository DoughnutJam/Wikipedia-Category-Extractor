# Wikipedia-Category-Extractor

The focus of the code in here will be to help me save time during work by extracting & categorizing different concepts from Wikipedia. 

**Category Page Project**

This project will focus on pulling Wikpedia links from a destinations' category page. It will then categorize these concepts/wiki links in a dataframe & CSV
This projects use case will be more geared towards country level destinations with thousands of concepts. 

**Things to Do Project**

The second project will be based on Google's Things to Do. Within it, it will focus on extracting wikipedia links from tabs that do have Wikipedia links & categorizing them in a dataframe/csv for use
